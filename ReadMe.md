This is a simple repository which when given a .csv format(see python_dataset.xlsx for an example) of git repositories will return the amount of lines of code and lines of comments within every repository in the .csv file.

Do note that all of the repositories must NOT be read only, a read only repository cannot be pulled using this clone method
